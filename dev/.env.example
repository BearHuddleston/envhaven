# Host path to this repo (REQUIRED for Docker-in-Docker setups)
#
# The Docker daemon runs on the host and can't see paths inside your container.
# This path is used to:
#   1. Mount extension source for live development
#   2. Mount test config at .test-config/ (auto-created, gitignored)
#
# Find it by checking where your container's workspace is mounted from.
#
# Example: /home/user/projects/envhaven
